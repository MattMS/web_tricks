# Web tricks

The purpose of this project is to show how to do the same tasks in the
browser using different libraries.

It is influenced by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), but has a different
aim.
While TodoMVC shows you how a whole application can be built with
different libraries, this only shows how smaller tasks are achieved.

The demos are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) but I
have included the compiled Javascript files with them.
You can view source on any demo page to view all the HTML and Javascript
used.


## Demo

- [Alert when the page has loaded](./page_loaded/)


## Tips

Anything that is prefixed with `my_` can be changed to whatever you
like, as long as it matches up with other places that variable is used.
