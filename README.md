# Web tricks

The purpose of this project is to show how to do the same tasks in the
browser using different libraries.

It is influenced by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), but has a different
aim.
While TodoMVC shows you how a whole application can be built with
different libraries, this only shows how smaller tasks are achieved.

Anything that is prefixed with `my_` can be changed to whatever you
like, as long as it matches up with other places that variable is used.
