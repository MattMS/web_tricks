# Web tricks

The purpose of this project is to show how to do the same tasks in the
browser using different libraries.

It is influenced by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/), but has a different
aim.
While TodoMVC shows you how a whole application can be built with
different libraries, this only shows how smaller tasks are achieved.


## Demo

- [Alert when the page has loaded](./page_loaded/).

- Save a value for
  [one session](./storage/session/)
  or
  [until the browser storage is cleared](./storage/browser/).


## Tips

The demos are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) but
include the compiled Javascript files in the same folder.
You can view source on any demo page to view all the HTML and Javascript
used.

Anything prefixed with `my_` can be changed to whatever you like, as
long as it matches other places the name is used.
