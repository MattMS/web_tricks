<p>The purpose of this project is to show how to do the same tasks in the
browser using different libraries.</p>
<p>It is influenced by <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a>, but has a different
aim.
While TodoMVC shows you how a whole application can be built with
different libraries, this only shows how smaller tasks are achieved.</p>
<p>Anything that is prefixed with <code>my_</code> can be changed to whatever you
like, as long as it matches up with other places that variable is used.</p>
